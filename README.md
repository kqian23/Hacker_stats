## What is a random walk?
It's a mathematical object describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps. Imagine rolling dice when playing Monopoly! In each turn, the number of steps that you can proceed by rolling the dice is random.

## Problem Scenario
Similar to Monopoly that we roll dice to determine steps, but this time our goal is to climb up a mansion as high as we can. The rules are as follow:
- if we roll a '1' or '2', we go down one floor
- if we roll a '3', '4', or '5', we go up one floor
- if we roll a '6', we roll the dice again! and walk up by the number of showing on the new dice

Roll the dice 100 times, and let's assume a free cocktail from the roof top bar will be awarded if I can reach level 60. What's the chance of me getting the free drink?
